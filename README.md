  <h1 align="center">Gatsby Netlify Catalog</h1>
</p>

Simple catalog implementation with React and Gatsby. Styled with Semantic-UI, hosted by Netlify and maintained by Netlify CMS. Think eCommerce without the credit card integration. Great for local businesses.

Check out my working example here: [https://www.gatsby-netlify-catalog.netlify.com/](https://www.gatsby-netlify-catalog.com/)

This project was heavily influenced by parmsang's [gatsby-starter-ecommerce](https://github.com/parmsang/gatsby-starter-ecommerce) repository. All props go to him. I recreated his platform and tweaked it to meet my cousin's local business needs, with the goal of learning Gatsby's more powerful features and dive into Semantic-UI's beautiful styling.
